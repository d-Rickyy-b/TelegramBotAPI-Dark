### Usage
To use this style, you need a browser plugin such as [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/). It injects custom CSS code into specified webpages.

Now either copy & paste the content of the [telegrambotapi-dark.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-Rickyy-b/TelegramBotAPI-Dark/main/telegrambotapi-dark.user.css) into the plugin you are using.

Or ðŸ“¦ [install the usercss](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-Rickyy-b/TelegramBotAPI-Dark/main/telegrambotapi-dark.user.css) automatically. Also supports automatic future updates.

### Found an issue
If you think you found an issue with the style, go ahead and open an issue in the GitHub issue tracker.
